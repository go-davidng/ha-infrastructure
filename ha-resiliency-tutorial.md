This tutorial walks you through setting up a resilient environment for an n-tier application in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} MZR. In this tutorial, you create your own VPC in region 1, then create subnets in two different zones of region 1, then you provision the virtual server instances. You create two availability zones and virtual server instances in each availability zone for UI, application, and db. 

## Objectives
{: #objectives-mzr}

* Setting up resilient VPC environment for the application

## Architecture
{: #architecture-mzr}

![Architecture](images/Deploying-critical-apps-with-IBM-Cloud-MZR.svg){: caption="Figure 1. Resiliency across multiple zones in a region" caption-side="bottom"}

1.  Provision multiple subnets (UI, application, and db) in each availability zone

    1.  AZ-1: Mgmt, UI, application, and db 
    2.  AZ-2: UI, application, and db

2.  Provision Placement groups for ui application.

3.  Provision virtual server instances

    1.  Bastion server (jumphost) in mgmt subnet and generate an SSH Key
    2.  Provision virtual server instances in the corresponding tiers with security groups

4.  Deploy a public load balancer and a private load balancer between tiers in each of availability zones.

## Before you begin

* Check permissions for VPC
* Generate SSH Keys from your workstation to connect to the bastion server

## Create a VPC
{: #create-vpc-mzr}
{: step}

To create your own {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC in region 1, complete these steps:

1.	Go to the VPC overview page and click **Get Started**.
2.	Select **Create**.
3.	Under New virtual private cloud section: 
    *	Enter ***vpc-region1*** as the name for your VPC.
    *	Select a **Resource group**.
    *	Optionally, add **Tags** to organize your resources.
4.	The default access control list (ACL) (Allow all) is appropriate for your VPC.
5.	Clear **Allow SSH** and **Allow ping** from the Default security group and leave classic access cleared. You add SSH access to the maintenance security group later. The maintenance security group must be added to an instance to allow SSH access from the bastion server. Ping access is not required for this tutorial.
6.	Leave **Create a default prefix for each zone checked**.
7.	Under **New subnet for VPC**: 
    *	Enter ***vpc1-region1-zone1-mgmt*** as your subnet's unique name.
    *	Select a **Resource group**.
    *	Select a location and zone 1 for example: Dallas and Dallas 1.
    *	Select the wanted number of IP addresses.
8.	Leave the access control list set to **Use VPC default**.
9.	Leave the public gateway set to **Detached**. 
10.	Click **Create virtual private cloud**.

## Create subnets in the same availability zone of region 1
{: #create-subnets-mzr}
{: step}

### Create subnets in availability zone 1
{: #create-subnets-same-az}

You create three extra subnets for your first availability zone (VPC-region1-zone1) and use the VPC you created in Step 1:
* vpc-region1-zone1-ui
* vpc-region1-zone1-application
* vpc-region1-zone1-db

To create the subnets:

1.	Click **Subnet**
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Enter ***vpc-region1-zone1-ui*** as a unique name for your subnet.
4.  Select ***vpc-region1*** as the VPC.
5.  Select a Resource group.
6.	Select a location zone 1 for example: **Dallas 1**.
7.	Select the wanted number of IP addresses.
8.	Leave the subnet access control list to the default selection.
9.	Leave the public gateway to **Detached**.
10.	Click **Create subnet**.
11.	Repeat steps 1-10 for the other two subnets and:
    *	Create a subnet that is called ***vpc-region1-zone1-app*** for application
    *	Create a subnet that is called ***vpc-region1-zone1-db1*** for db

### Create subnets for availability zone 2 
{: #create-subnets-other-az}

Use this task to create subnets for availability zones two and three. You repeat the steps in this task multiple times to create seven subnets:

|Zone|Subnet|
|----|----|
|vpc-region1-zone2|vpc-region1-zone2-ui  /n vpc-region1-zone2-app  /n vpc-region1-zone2-db1|

To create the subnets: 


1.  Enter ***vpc-region1-zone2-ui*** as a unique name for your subnet.
2.  Select ***vpc-region1*** as the VPC, and 
3.  Select a **Resource group**.
4.	Select a location for zone two for example: Dallas 2
5.	Select the wanted number of IP addresses.
6.	Leave the subnet access control list set to the default selection.
7.	Leave the public gateway set to **Detached**.
8.	Click **Create subnet**.
9.	Repeat steps 1-8 for availability zone 2:
    * Create a subnet that is called ***vpc-region1-zone2-app*** 
    * Create a subnet that is called ***vpc-region1-zone2-db1***

To confirm that the subnets are created, click **Subnets** on the left pane and wait until the status changes to **Available**.
  
## Create two security groups to allow only specific inbound traffic to the server and application
{: #create-security-groups}
{: step}

To specify which traffic to allow to the application, you deploy rules, which you add to the virtual server instances in the later steps.
*	Enable an inbound rule for SSH traffic to jumphost
*	Enable specific ports for the corresponding application of each tier. For example, if the front-end server needs HTTP and HTTPs, then a security group is needed to allow for port 80 and 443. 

To create the security groups:

1.	Go to **Security Groups**.
2.	Verify that the Regions setting is correct and if not then select the correct region, for example: Dallas
3.  Click **Create**.
4.	Create the security group ***vpc-region1-jumphost-sg***: 

    1. Set the VPC to ***vpc-region1***
        
    2. Select your **Resource Group**

    3. Add one **Inbound rule**:  Set **Protocol** to ***TCP***, **Port Min and Max** to ***22***, and **Source Type** to ***Any***.

    4. Add one **Outbound rule**: Set **Protocol** to ***All*** and **Destination type** to ***Any***.

5. Create the security group ***vpc-region1-ui-sg***:

    1. Set the VPC to ***vpc-region1***
        
    2. Select your **Resource Group**

    3. Add three **Inbound rules**:

        * Set **Protocol** to ***TCP***, **Port Min and Max** to ***22***, and **Source Type** to ***Any***.
        * Set **Protocol** to ***TCP***, **Port Min and Max** to ***80***, and **Source Type** to ***Any***.
        * Set **Protocol** to ***TCP***, **Port Min and Max** to ***443***, and **Source Type** to ***Any***.
  
    4. Add one Outbound rule: set the **Protocol** to ***All*** and **Destination type** to ***Any***.

6.	Create security groups for ***app*** and ***db***. Use these guidelines:
    *  Allow SSH (port 22) for bastion access.
    *  If web access is required, then use HTTPS (port 443) for secure communication.
    *  Add any additional specific ports required for the respective tiers.
    *Avoid allowing all. Instead, create an allow list.

## Create placement groups
{: #create-placement-groups}
{: step}

There are different approaches and strategies when it comes with placement groups.  You can create a placement group per zone, per tier, per stack and so forth.  For this example, create 2 placement groups, one placement group each for ui and application. The placement group spans the availability zones.

1. Go to **Placement groups**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter ***web-group1*** as the placement group unique name.
4. Select your **Resource Group**.
5. Select your **Region**.
6. Select ***Host spread*** as your **Placement strategy**.
7. Click **Create placement group**.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 for app-group1.

## Create virtual server instances

2.	Enter ***vpc-lb-ui*** as the unique name, and select:
    *  **vpc-region1** as your Virtual private cloud. 
    *  **Application load balancer** as the load balancer. 
    *  The resource group. 
    *  region1 as the region. 
    *  Load balancer Type: **Public**.

3.	In **Subnets**, select **vpc-region1-zone1-ui** and **vpc-region1-zone2-ui**.
4.	Click **New pool** to create a new back-end pool of virtual server instances that act as equal peers to share the traffic that is routed to the pool. Set the parameters with these values: 
    *	**Name**: region1-zone1-pool
    *	**Protocol**: HTTP
    *	**Session stickiness**: Source IP
    *   **Proxy Protocol**: - Depends
    *	**Method**: Round robin 
    *	**Health check path**: /
    *	**Health protocol**: HTTP
    *	**Health port**: Leave blank
    *	**Interval(sec)**: 15
    *	**Timeout(sec)**: 5
    *	**Max retries**: 2
5.  Click **Save**.
6.	Create a back-end pool:
    1. Click **Attach** to add server instances to the region1-pool.
    2. Add the CIDR range that is associated with **vpc-region1-zone1-ui**, select the virtual server instance (vpc-region1-zone1-ui1) that you created and set 80 as the port. Repeat for the other virtual server instance, vpc-region1-zone1-ui2.
    3.	Click **Save** to complete the creation of a back-end pool.
7.	Click **New listener** and create a Front-end listener process that checks for connection requests: 

    1. Set the listener values:

        *	**Protocol**: HTTP
        *	**Port**: 80
        *	**Back-end pool**: region1-zone1-pool
        *	**Max connections**: Leave it empty 
        
    2.  Click **Save**.
8.  Click **Create load balancer**.
9.  Repeat steps 1-8 to create the other load balancer for the application tier. Set the **Type** to **Private** and change to **Port** to the port applicable to the tier that is being serviced.
