# Customizing a three-tier highly available infrastructure VPC in a multi-zone region with automation
{: #create-three-tier-resilient-vpc-mzr-modular} 

Highly available and resilient infrastructures for multi-zone region include multiple components and connections. The individual pieces can be created manually with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} dashboard, but it is a time-intensive process. To streamline the process, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides several methods to automate deployment by using Terraform as a base. You can run the Terraform scripts yourself, or use the catalog tile or Schematics user interface to run the scripts. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure that is created uses Intel Xeon CPUs and additional Intel technologies.

All infrastructures have a core set of features that are used. With Terraformans Schematics, you can customize your infrastructure by adding the features that you want. Features can not be individually selected with the Catalog tile.

You can select how you want to deploy the architecture:
*   Deploy on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} - Use the user interface to enter the information for your infrastructure.
*   Run locally - Download script files to your local machine to configure and run.

Catalog tile and Schematics instructions are both located in the UI tab of this topic.

## Core and Feature modules for Terraform and Schematics
{: #mzr-core-feature-modules}

For Terraform and Schematics deployments, the components in a multi-zone region 3-tier infrastructure are divided into modules so that you can customize your infrastructure to your needs. You receive all of the core components and can turn feature components on or off as needed. Modules are not available for the Catalog tile deployment.

|Feature    |   Resources   |
|-----------|-------------|
|Core     | Resources needed for a multi-zone region infrastructure. All resources are configured.  \n - VPC  \n -  Region  \n - Subnet  \n - Security Group  \n - ALB LBaaS  \n - web VSI + host placement groups  \n - Private LBaaS  \n - App VSI + host placement groups  \n -  DB VSI + secondary block volumes + power placement groups  \n - Instance group  \n - VPN  \n - Public Gateway  \n - File  \n - Cloud Object Storage  \n - Public or Private (web LBaaS)|

## What is created
{: #created-vpc-ha-resilient-mzr-modular}

A VPC is a private space in IBM Cloud where you can run an isolated environment with custom network policies. The variables that you define are used by the scripts to provision the virtual private cloud infrastructure resources for you. The default values in the scripts are used to create these resources in a multi-zone region: 

|Resource Name      |             Quantity  | 
|-------------------|-----------------------|  
| VPC             |                 01    |     
| Security Groups    |              05    |     
| Subnets      |                    10    |     
| Bastion VSI        |              01    |     
| App VSI            |              05    |     
| Web VSI           |               05    |     
| Database VSI    |                 06    |     
| Floating IP     |                 01    |  

The scripts use variables to specify your account information, VSI server information, Load Balancer information, Auto scale, and Anti-Affinity

The scripts automatically install these software packages:

*  PHP
*  Apache
*  Maria DB
*  Word Press Application


## Caveats
{: #limitations-ha-resilient-mzr-modular}

The bastion server is important to access other VSIs. 

Don’t delete the bastion server or update its OS image after creation (**Apply plan**) because the bastion server is used to access other servers. If the Bastion server is removed, you lose access to your infrastructure. Get a snapshot of the bastion server for backup and recovery.

## Before you begin
{: #before-begin-ha-resilient-mzr-modular}

* [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the IBM Cloud platform and to determine your permissions for IBM Cloud services.
* [Create or retrieve your SSH key name](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). The SSH key is used to SSH to the bastion server.
* Collect the information that you need to specify for the script parameters:

    |Component type   | Parameter values needed |
    |-----------------|--------------------|
    |User-specific information  | - API key  \n - SSH key or keys  \n - Resource Group  \n - IP address or addresses  \n - Your local machine OS \n - Prefix to add to resource names |

## Customizing a three-tier highly available infrastructure VPC in a multi-zone region with Schematics
{: #create-vpc-mzr-schematics-modular}
{: ui}

To use the files in the GitHub repo in Schematics, you need a personal access token. When you create the token, copy it to a text file for future use. When you leave the create token page, you can no longer view the token.  

1.  Go to the [MZR GitHub repository](https://github.ibm.com/workload-eng-services/ha-mzr). 
2.  Select **Settings** from your account icon menu.
3.  Select **Developer settings**.
4.  Select **Personal Access Tokens**.
5.  Select **Generate new token**.
6.  Copy the new token and save it in a text file.

After you have your access token, use Schematics to create your infrastructure.

1.	From the IBM Cloud menu, select [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview).
2.  Click **Workspaces**.
3.	Click **Create workspace**.
4.  On the **Specify template** page:

## Customizing a three-tier highly available infrastructure VPC in a multi-zone region with Terraform
{: #procedure-ha-resilient-mzr-terraform-modular}
{: terraform}

Use these steps to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in and use Terraform to create a resilient infrastructure for a 3-tier application.

1.	If Terraform is not installed on your machine, [Install the Terraform CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-setup_cli). You use Terraform v0.13.0 or greater and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug in v1.26.0.

2.	Create a project folder in the Terraform installation folder, and change directory to your project folder.

    `mkdir myproject && cd myproject`

3.	Copy the files from [vpc-ha-iac GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/vpc-ha-iac) single-region folder to the project folder that you created in the Terraform installation folder.

4.  Enter your solution-specific information in the `sample.userinput.auto.tfvars` file.  Follow the instructions in the file comments. When you are done, remove the `#` at the beginning of each line and save the file as `userinput.auto.tfvars`. If you do not modify and save the `userinput.auto.tfvars`, the script prompts you for the information during the `terraform plan` command.

    You update the information that you collected in the Before you begin section. 
    * Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
    * Your 40-digit resource group ID.
    * Your SSH for the region where you are creating resources.
    * Your public IP address. 
    * Your local machine type, for example, Windows, Linux, or Mac
    * A prefix to use for your resources so that you can easily identify them. 
    * The region the resources are created in. For example, us-south-1, or br-sao.
    * For each server, Bastion, app, web, db, you enter the:
        * Custom image ID for the server. Images are region-specific. To find the image IDs for your region, open the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} shell and enter `ibmcloud target -r < region_name >` to set your region, then `ibmcloud is images` to see a list of images for that region.
        * OS image to use, either Windows or Linux.
        * The CPU percentage for the App Instance Group
        * The minimum number of servers to have in the App Instance Group for Auto scale.
        * The maximum nuber of server to have in the App Instance Group for Auto scale.
        * The bandwidth per second in GB. 
        * The VSI spread strategy for the db server (host or power spread) for anti-affinity. Power spread is recommended here.
        * The VSI spread strategy for the web and app servers (host or power spread) for anti-affinity. Host spread is recommended here if more than 4 are created for each server type.


5.	Initialize the Terraform CLI. 

    `terraform init`

6.	Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.

    `terraform plan`

    The scripts prompt you for information about your resources if you did not specify them in the `userinput.auto.tfvars` file.  

7.	Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the `userinput.auto.tfvars` and `modules .tf` file and run `terraform plan` again.

8.	Create the virtual private cloud for SAP instance and IAM access policy in IBM Cloud.

    `terraform apply`

    The virtual private cloud and components are created and you see output similar to the terraform plan output. 

## Next Steps
{: terraform}

If you need to rename your resources after they are created, modify the `example.userinput.auto.tfvars` and `modules.tf` file to change the names and run terraform plan and terraform apply again. 

Do not use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard and user interface to modify your VPC after it is created. The Terraform scripts create a complete solution and selectively modifying resources with the user interface might cause unexpected results. 

If you need to remove your VPC, use `terraform destroy`. The Bastion server is protected for inadvertent deletion. Before you run the `terraform destroy` command, you need to set the `prevent_destroy` flag to `false` to remove your VPC. The `prevent_destroy` flag is located in `./modules/bastion/compute.tf`.
